# notes for river blackfish population model

# northern and southern forms (Miller et al. 2004, Memoirs Museum Vic. 61(2):121-127),
#   arguably the Glenelg/south-west Vic are southern form (invaded from Tas) and
#   MDB fish are northern form (historical Vic/NSW/QLD form)
# Some confusion b/w G marmoratus and G bispinosis (marmoratus = larger, esp. in south Vic)

# grows to 600 mm, commonly 300 mm at full length (males, female lengths unknown)

# spawning as for Murray cod (large eggs, nest guarding)
# relatively low fecundity

# likes streams with gravel substrate and snags
# likes lotic conditions
# BUT likes instream cover, wtih rocks or woody debris to shelter from fast-flowing conditions
# can tolerate water temps of 5-25C

# home ranging (like Murray cod)

# spawns Oct-Dec (possibly Sep/Jan as well)

# siltation bad because they like small, upland streams
