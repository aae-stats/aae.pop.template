aae.pop.templates is a package of template population dynamics models to use with the [aae.pop package](https://aae-stats.github.io/aae.pop/). Currently implemented models focus primarily on freshwater fish species, with all current models developed by researchers the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research. As well as providing implementations for several species, the `aae.pop.templates` package is intended to demonstrate a way to record population dynamics models in a reproducible and updateable form. 

The [aae.pop website](https://aae-stats.github.io/aae.pop) includes examples of these population dynamics models in action.

You can install the current version of the package from Github:

``` r
remotes::install_github("aae-stats/aae.pop.templates")
```
