aae.pop.templates is a package of template population dynamics models to use with the [aae.pop package](https://aae-stats.github.io/aae.pop/). Currently implemented models focus primarily on freshwater fish species, with all current models developed by researchers the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research.

The [aae.pop website](https://aae-stats.github.io/aae.pop) includes examples of these population dynamics models in action.

You can install the current version of the package from Github:

``` r
remotes::install_github("aae-stats/aae.pop.templates")
```
